        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
        Kehlani Ashley Parrish was born on April 24, 1995, in Oakland, California. They were adopted
        and raised by their aunt when their mother, who had a drug addiction, served time in jail. 
        Kehlani's father, who also had a drug addiction, died when they were a toddler. During their 
        teenage years, they attended the Oakland School for the Arts, where they initially practiced 
        dance, particularly ballet and modern dance. Early in their life, Kehlani aspired to train as 
        a dancer at the Juilliard School, but they had a knee injury in junior high, which led them 
        to turn their attention towards singing. While living with their aunt, Kehlani was exposed 
        almost exclusively to R&B and neo soul artists, such as Lauryn Hill, Erykah Badu and Jill Scott, 
        whom today they describe as some of their early musical influences. When they were 14, Kehlani 
        was recruited to join a local pop cover band, Poplyfe.

        <h2>Sexuality and Gender Identity</h2>
            <p>
                In April 2018, they spoke about their sexuality on Twitter, stating, "I'm queer. Not bi, not 
                straight. I'm attracted to women, men, REALLY attracted to queer men, non-binary 
                people, intersex people, trans people. lil poly pansexual". After that, during a live stream 
                in early 2021, Kehlani announced that they identify as a lesbian, after having publicly
                identified as queer and pansexual in the past. They prefer polyamorous relationships. 
                They have stated that it is important for them to include female pronouns in their music.
                In an April 2019 interview with Diva magazine, Kehlani stated they are "definitely on the 
                non-binary scale" although preferred "she" pronouns. In December 2020, Kehlani updated their 
                pronouns on Twitter to "she/they". In an interview with Byrdie Magazine in 2021, they stated their 
                preference for "they" over "she", because "something feels really affirming when people say they",
                and that "it feels like you really see me".
